## code-lab-1
In this code lab, I had fun to reproduce as well as possible the model of an iphone 13 pro MAX in HTML5, SASS & CSS3.

## Difficulties encountered and solutions
- Designing the Apple logo in pure CSS was not easy at first. I first wanted to play with the pseudo elements and then with transform rotate to be able to design the crooked parts.
But I couldn't, I opted for another approach which consisted in creating three divs representing the crunched parts of the apple and playing with absolute position to position up, right and down. I applied a background color that is identical to the background color of the parent container, then added rounded edges to simulate the crunched parts.
- The second difficulty is the mixing of the sensor colors, which I couldn't do, and also this kind of shadow on the camera plate with its rounded edges. I tried with a box shadow on the container of the plate, then with another on the pseudo element after to arrive at the current result.
- Finally the last difficulty concerns the edges of the iphone with its buttons. There too, I played with the borders and the absolute positions to get the current result.

## Impressions
I leave enriched with new experiences in CSS integration at the end of this code lab. Among these experiences, we can mention the use of box-shadow, pseudo-elements, etc.
